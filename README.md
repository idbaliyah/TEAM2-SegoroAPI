## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SRZMxez8Ux2LA_P0nq0KgeeI3kNwIhwE/view?usp=share_link)

There are a lot of problems raised when you want to book a field for you and your clicks to play badminton, football/futsal, basketball, voley, or even swimming. Some of us often forget to call your favourite venue to secure your field in your busy days. Sometimes when you book via chat you are not sure is the field will available when you want it? Are you sure you have paid for it? But where's the payment slip?

As an user, SegoroAPP will help you to:
* Save your time to book, no NEED to survey the venue
* Track your booking schedule & history
* Seach some new awesome venue around you :smile:
* Track your payment
* Give your favourite venue a good review
* Become an owner yourself

Not a big fan of sport but you have venues to promote? Don't worry, we got you covered! You can game-up your promotion and get more customer just by clicks. 

As an owner, SegoroAPP will help you to:
* Add venues and detail to promote
* Check your venue booking schedule and history
* Check payment

Also, we make sure it is secure and neat. SegoroAPP also has Admin to make sure everything runs well.

As an admin, you can:
* Upgrade an user to become an owner
* Manage users and owner
* Manage venues and fields
* Basically, help you with whatever you need from the app
